Hello, Mr. Aiello my name is Isaac mendoza and i'm in the 9th grade Gsteam program at Chatsworth. I do not nor have I ever worked with coding throughout elementary or middle school years. Things I expect to learn in this class range from things like coding but also light hacking as mentioned today in sixth period. Obviously I don't expect to learn anything major but I still expect to learn a decent amount that'll help me throughout the years.


When it comes to homework I tend to do it last minute as shown when doing this assignment. Especially, when I have multiple days/weeks to complete a certain assignment. I tend to procrastinate a lot and its been something I've been trying to work on. I don't really enjoy writing or typing things much because I never really know what to write about because I usually at least need some specific guidelines in order to start something at all. 


Some hobbies I typically do is participate in a recreational soccer team outside of school and play for them every sundays with practices during the week. I'm usually the type of person who's always tired and that's my main reason for being tired most of the time. I enjoy playing soccer and will be trying out for the Chatsworth team whenever try-outs begin because its one things that I really enjoy doing more than most. Another thing about me is I don't really listen to music at all so I don't really know what to put after this because I genuinley don't really like listening to music because it does not really benefit me at all. In the end I hope this year goes smoothly because I really hate to poor in effort just to get a c or lower in any of my classes.
